# Truss-Bridge-Design-Project
Engineering 101 (Fall 2019) Project 1

# Introduction
The project aimed to test and design various types of truss bridges capable of spanning 44 meters with low cost, force to strength ratio of 0.5, and a safety factor of 2.0 or greater. Preliminary research was initially done on four different truss styles, giving one insight into determining which truss would best fit the given criteria before testing. Truss models were built using PASCO structural beams spanning 29 inches and tested using the SparkVue software in the FEP Build Lab. The Bridge Designer 2016 software was then used to test forces and strengths of each truss before concluding the results.

# 1.1 Problem Statement
While responding to a request from the Department of Transportation, a new truss bridge to carry a two-lane highway across the river valley was designed. The river valley was 24 meters deep, with an average incline of 63 degrees, resulting in an opening at the top of 44 meters. Overarching problems of the design include the cost of the project, along with the overall strength and safety rating of the structure. The aim was to have the force to strength ratio close to 0.5 and safety rating close to 2.0 while keeping the cost to a minimum. All truss designs were evaluated to determine which ones fit the above mentioned criteria.

# 1.2 Objective
The aim was to research several different truss designs and test them under load to determine which is the most appropriate structure for the given project. Next, the relative cost of each design was compared to their overall structural stability. Finally, findings were presented in the following report and presentation delivered to the class, along with the chosen truss design and why it was particularly chosen.
